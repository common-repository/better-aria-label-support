Better aria-label support for WordPress (including menus).

== Description ==

Better aria-label support for WordPress. For now, it only includes menu items, but there's more to come!

First step: the plugin replaces the "Title" field in WordPress Menus screen with an "Aria label" field, and applies the change to the navigation menus in front-end.

Thanks [Val√©rie Galassi](https://profiles.wordpress.org/valer1e/) for the original idea.
